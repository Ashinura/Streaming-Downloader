Work on python 3.11.4

1 - Make sure you have python installed on your computer or installed it with the microsoft store or via python.org
2 - Add the python.exe folder in your user and system path, it should be "C:\PythonXXX" or "C:\Users\ur_name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python.exe"
3 - Run 'setup.bat' in 'Setup' folder, if you get "Warning script location" during the installation, I suggest you to add the path to your system too if you get error during the download.
4 - Run 'launch.bat'
5 - Download your musics :>

Spotify : 'spotdl' package uses YouTube as a source for music downloads, this means that if music is on spotify but you can't download it after trying again, your music isn't on YouTube or it can't find it.

If you encounter any problems, errors or requests, please let me know on github : https://github.com/Ashinura/Streaming-Downloader/issues
